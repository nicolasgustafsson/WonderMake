# WonderMake

## Introduction
WonderMake is a game engine written using c++ 20. It's main design point is that you have to list all dependencies when declaring different systems or functionalities. These dependencies will be created and then be injected so they're ready to be used before the constructor of your system/functionality is called.

## Dependencies
- [CMake 3.10](https://cmake.org/)
- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/)
