Currently this is only effects applied on a character, though in the future there will also be a WorldEffect that can take place anywhere

Effect strength is the following; it is based on buff strength:
0 = No effect
1 = Not noticeable effect
10 = Small effect "boring buff".
100 = Big effect.
500 = Enormous effect
1000 = Game-winning effect
