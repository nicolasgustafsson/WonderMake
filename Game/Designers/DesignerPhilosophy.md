The underlying idea behind designers is to emulate the human thought process; how would a live human being develop this thing in a gamedev environment?

Usually the process will be some varying of the following:

*Get handed a basic design or a list of requirements
*Develop an abstract idea of what it will do
*Concretize the abstract idea until the abstract idea has become the thing requested
*Hand the finished object to the requester

The goal of this is to generate content similar to how a studio would do it, for instance:

The director says we need a spooky level, it asks the level designer for one
The level designer creates a base level design, then asks environment art to make it spooky
Environment art adds a bunch of skulls to the level and hands it back to the level designer
The level designer asks weapon design to create a spooky weapon to go with the level
The weapon designer creates a spooky weapon and hands it to the level designer
The level designer returns it to the director which puts it in the game
